# Hi! I'm your manager.
Welcome aboard. I'm excited to work with you.

## My role as your manager
I strongly feel that managers work for their direct reports. It is my
responsibility to:
* empower you to do your best job
* help you become excited to come to work
* ensure your work here aligns as much as possible with your own career goals
* unblock your work as necessary
* provide support, answer questions, offer advice, help you navigate your job
* ensure you're recognized for your accomplishments (publicly if that's cool with you — I'll ask)

## My expectations as your manager

### Within your first week
* complete onboarding and training (outlined elsewhere)
* update your profile picture so everyone can begin to know you, especially
 * Slack
 * GitHub
 * Gravatar (register using your work email address)
* set up your laptop

### Always and forever
* do your best
* be respectful to your colleagues
* communicate openly
* tell me when you have a different viewpoint
* update this document if it's wrong (all of my direct reports have edit access)
* respect our core working hours of 10am – 3pm

## 1:1s
As soon as you start, I'll schedule weekly 1:1s with you. The frequency of these might change based on your feedback and schedule. These meetings will be scheduled for an hour. We may not need the whole time — it's entirely up to you.

First and foremost these meetings are for you. These are not status updates (there are other meetings for those). During our first 1:1, we'll walk through this document, and I'll ask you the following questions geared towards getting to know you better:

* What are you interests, both professional and personal (if you're willing to share)?
* How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)
* Can you share a story about a recent achievement that you're proud of?

On subsequent 1:1s, we prioritize your agenda. If we have time, I'll ask the following questions:

* How's life?
* What's something that went well (maybe something you're proud of) since we last met?
* What's something that didn't go well since we last met?

And I will always ask: _Do you have any feedback for me? Are there areas that I can improve on?_ I would prefer this feedback in person, but you can always share it with me via Slack, email, or with someone above me in the management chain so they can share your feedback anonymously with me.

## Your goals
I'd like you to think about your career goals. Each quarter, translate them into achievable quarterly deliverables that also have benefit to the company.

You'll schedule a meeting for us to brainstorm your goals every six months. That meeting should include me (your manager) and your peer sponsor (someone within our organization who has gotten to know you well and you feel has your best interests in mind). In this session, we'll each come up with goals for you, discuss them, then prioritize them for the next two quarters. I understand that goals can change, so ultimately it's up to you to figure out how they should evolve. I'm more than happy to discuss your goals at any time if they've changed significantly.

## Communication

Please know that *I am available any time for you*. Come up to me in person, send me a meeting invite, email, Slack message, or call me on video chat. You can Slack me 24 hours a day. I almost always respond quickly, and I enjoy to do so.

From time to time I work evenings or weekends. This is my choice. I might reach out to you on Slack or send you an email. I by no means expect you to respond outside of normal business hours (9am – 5pm) or on weekends. If I do have a question that requires an immediate response, I'll add an "URGENT" label to it.

## Thanks for reading this far!
Now let's go build something truly great together.
